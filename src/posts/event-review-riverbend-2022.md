I attended my first Riverbend Festival and had a blast! Riverbend is a multi-day music festival held here in Chattanooga, that started in 1982. This year it was a three-day festival, June 3-5, at Ross's Landing right next to the Tennessee River and the Aquarium.

Prior to the festival I only recognized a few of the artists, but part of the fun of attending is discovering new music and artists. There have definitely been some songs and artists who have stuck in my head since then. 

Friday was our day to volunteer, so we got there early to help with any last minute set up, and to make sure we were at our stations when the gates opened. Luckily we were set up in front of the Skybox, so we had a good view of two of the three stages.
