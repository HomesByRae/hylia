I read an interesting [article](https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/february-2022-realtors-confidence-index-survey-buyer-competition-intensifies-to-5-offers-per-home) from National Association of Realtors earlier today, so I wanted to share the article and my thoughts on it. I also wanted to share how the market here in Chattanooga did for February compared to February of last year. 

So, first things first: every month the NAR releases data about how the housing market did nationwide the previous month. I enjoy reading this to see how things are going, but also because they talk about what they think is going to happen. 

For example, in February, every home listed received approximately 5 offers on it. Also, roughly half of buyers are still offering over asking price (around 2.9% of asking price) which based on the median home price comes to about $10,000 extra. So that's something to consider if you're thinking of buying. You'll need to make sure you have your earnest money, down payment, closing costs, and any money for inspections. If you're thinking of offering over asking price then I'd recommend either looking at homes around $10K less than what you're approved for, or having the cash to pay the difference.

Another thing to consider, especially for those looking to buy a home, is that buyers typically offer on 3 homes before their offer is accepted. All hope is not lost though, because about a quarter of buyers get their first offer accepted. I mention this because I know how heartbreaking it can be to put an offer on a dream home and have it rejected. Buying a home is an exciting and emotional time, and if I can help you be prepared by sharing information, it might ease the sting a little if you know it's a possibility. 

For those of you thinking of selling your home, most homes are on the market less than a month.  The average amount of time homes stayed on the market last month was 18 days. Last year the average was 20 days. I know here in Chattanooga, it's unsurprising for homes to be pending within a couple days of going on the market.

And now the part that has me concerned. Because the mortgage rates are rising, and are expected to continue rising, the NAR predicts competition for homes will increase this year. If the rates get to 6% like it's scheduled to in 2023, first-time buyers making less than $80,000 will be priced out of the market. If rates get to 4.5%, about 1.4 million renters will not be able to afford a home.

I remember how hard it was for my husband and I to buy a home around 6 years ago. We couldn't afford much and anything in our price range either needed major renovations, or we lost out to investors who offered all cash. I would love to see new neighborhoods pop up, with smaller, affordable homes. I think well built houses, that maximized the space there, but topped out at 1,500 sq ft would do really well nowadays. But I digress.

As for the Chattanooga market for February, listings are up over last February, even though inventory is still down. Pending sales, closed sales, and average sales price are also up. Days on the market has dropped by almost half of what it was this time last year. So this is a great time if you're looking to sell your home. I think things will only get better since Spring is here, and more people are planning on putting their homes on the market. 

So, that's all I have for you today. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'll answer your questions to the best of my ability. Thanks for reading!
