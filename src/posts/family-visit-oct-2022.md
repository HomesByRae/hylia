We recently had family come visit for the first time and enjoyed showing them things in this wonderful city we now call home. We had a decent mix of things we have and haven't done yet. If you're looking for something to do, hopefully this helps you too. 

Without further ado, here is my list of favorite things to do in the Chattanooga area:

![](/images/20221026_151945_hdr.jpg)

~Attend a [UTC Mocs football](https://gomocs.com/sports/football) game in the fall, or a [Chattanooga Lookouts](https://www.milb.com/chattanooga/) baseball game in the summer.

~Drive to Ocoee to visit the dams and the [Olympic Whitewater site](https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/destination/ocoee-whitewater-center). (Note: the Whitewater center burned down earlier this year, but the site is still open to walk around.)

~Walk around the Bluff View Art District, Walnut Street Bridge, Coolidge Park, and the Riverwalk.

~Visit [Enterprise South Nature Park](https://parks.hamiltontn.gov/148/Enterprise-South-Nature-Park). We love walking the trails, but if you can't the drive is pretty too.

~Shop at [The Samaritan Center](https://thesamaritancenter.net/stores/), McKee Foods Bakery Store, and [McKays Used Books](http://www.mckaybooks.com/).

~Ride the free electric shuttle around downtown Chattanooga and explore places along the route, such as the public library, the [Chattanooga Choo Choo](https://www.choochoo.com/), Miller Plaza, and [MoonPie General Store](https://shop.moonpie.com/). Did you know MoonPie was created for miners, like my beloved WV pepperoni rolls?

~Hike some trails at White Oak Mountain behind Southern Adventist University. Their student center is cool and fun to walk around.

~Ride the [Lookout Mountain Incline Railway](https://ridetheincline.com/) (and not get freaked out during the last little bit when it feels like you're going to fall out of your seat) and enjoy the view. Then walk over to the [Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park](https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/index.htm). Enjoy the peace and views there.

~Camp and kayak at [Harrison Bay State Park](https://tnstateparks.com/parks/harrison-bay). When we first visited Chattanooga we stayed here and loved it. It's beautiful, peaceful, and only half an hour from downtown.

I know there are lots of amazing things to do in the Chattanooga area and I've missed quite a few, but that just means they'll have to come back. What are some of your favorite things to do here? I'd love to hear from you!
