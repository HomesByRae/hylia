My in-laws were in town this past week, visiting us for the first time since we moved to Chattanooga in 2019. I wanted to share with you what we did, because I thought it would be helpful if you're planning on having guests from out of town. 

First, we started off by going to the UTC-Mercer game on Saturday, and had fun watching the Mocs win! On our way back to the car, we decided to pop into Gordon Food Service Store just to look around. It's a cross between a regular grocery store and a warehouse store, so it's not uncommon to find a regular can of, for example, refried beans right next to a Number 10 can of refried beans.

We then had a late lunch at Taziki's Mediterranean Cafe, which was excellent, as usual. We also hopped on the electric shuttle and rode it over to the Chattanooga Choo Choo. No visit to downtown is complete without stopping by Moon Pie General Store, and we made sure to pick up all the current flavors of Moon Pie.

Sunday we decided to drive to Ocoee to enjoy the view of the fall leaves. We stopped by two of the three dams and walked around a bit. We didn't get a chance to walk around the Olympic whitewater rafting site much, so that's definitely on our list of places we'd like to visit again.

Monday we drove around Enterprise South Nature Park, visited McKee Foods Bakery Store, the Bluff View Art District, Walnut Street Bridge, and enjoyed dinner at Champy's. 

Tuesday saw us visiting Chattanooga Quilts in Ooltewah,The Samaritan Center, a drive around Southern Adventist University, dinner at Firebirds Wood Fired Grill, and a walk around the Hamilton Place Mall.

Wednesday we ate lunch at Uncle Larry's, then headed over to the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway, walked around Point Park and the Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park. The evening was rounded out with dinner at City Cafe Diner.

We know we missed a lot of great things in the Chattanooga area, but are looking forward to the next visit. Is there anything you love to do in the Chattanooga area? Any hidden gems you'd recommend? I'd love to hear from you!
