My in-laws were in town this last week, visiting us for the first time since we moved to Chattanooga in 2019. I wanted to share with you what we did, because I thought it would be helpful if you're planning on having guests from out of town.

First, we started off by going to the [UTC](https://gomocs.com/sports/football)-Mercer football game that Saturday, and had fun watching the Mocs win! On our way back to the car, we decided to pop into [Gordon Food Service Store](https://gfsstore.com/ads/?dsr_id=MP207) just to look around. It's a cross between a regular grocery store and a warehouse store, so it's not uncommon to find a regular can of, for example, refried beans right next to a Number 10 can.

We then had a late lunch at [Taziki's Mediterranean Cafe](https://www.tazikis.com/), which was excellent, as usual. They wanted to visit the [Chattanooga Choo Choo](https://www.choochoo.com/), so we hopped on the free electric shuttle and walked around for a little bit.

No visit to downtown is complete without stopping by [MoonPie General Store](https://shop.moonpie.com/), and we made sure to pick up all the current flavors. I didn't realize MoonPie was created for the coal miners, like my beloved West Virginia pepperoni rolls, so that was neat to discover.

Sunday we decided to drive to Ocoee to enjoy the view of the fall leaves. We stopped by two of the three dams and walked around. We didn't get a chance to walk around the [Olympic whitewater](https://www.tva.com/energy/our-power-system/hydroelectric/ocoee-no.-3) rafting site much, so that's definitely on our list of places we'd like to visit again.

Monday we drove around [Enterprise South Nature Park](https://parks.hamiltontn.gov/148/Enterprise-South-Nature-Park), and even went inside one of the bunkers. We also visited the [McKee Foods Bakery Store](https://www.mckeefoods.com/www) so they could pick up some Little Debbie snacks for family back in Texas. Later that evening they walked around the [Bluff View Art District](https://bluffviewartdistrictchattanooga.com/), [Walnut Street Bridge](https://www.walnutstreetbridge.com/), and enjoyed dinner at [Champy's World Famous Fried Chicken](https://champyschicken.com/).

Tuesday saw us visiting [Chattanooga Quilts](https://chattanoogaquilts.com/) in Ooltewah, since my mother-in-law is a quilter. I enjoyed seeing all the quilt patterns and sets they had. Next, we visited [The Samaritan Center](https://thesamaritancenter.net/), our favorite local thrift store. We decided to drive around [Southern Adventist University](https://www.southern.edu/)'s beautiful campus, had dinner at [Firebirds Wood Fired Grill](https://chattanooga.firebirdsrestaurants.com/), and walked around the [Hamilton Place Mall](https://www.hamiltonplace.com/).

Wednesday we ate lunch at Uncle Larry's, which is always amazing. We love their catfish, and have a great time every time we go. 

We then headed over to the [Lookout Mountain Incline Railway](https://ridetheincline.com/) and we rode it for the first time. It was a strange experience climbing aboard, but the view up was incredible. The part that made me the most nervous was that last little part where it gets really steep and you feel like you're going to fall out of your chair, but the view at the top was worth it.

Once we were at the top we walked over to Point Park and the [Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park](https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/index.htm). I think the view from there is of my very favorites. It was peaceful, and it was hard to remember we were so close to downtown. I ended up taking way too many pictures, but there was an icredible view everywhere I looked.The evening was rounded out with dinner at [City Cafe Diner](https://www.thecitycafemenu.com/) and everyone left stuffed.

We know we missed a lot of great things in the Chattanooga area, but are looking forward to the next visit. Is there anything I missed on your must visit list? Any hidden gems you'd recommend? I'd love to hear from you!
