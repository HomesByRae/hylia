This last weekend, my husband and I volunteered at Rock the Riverfront, put on by River City Company, in downtown Chattanooga. We were in charge of keeping an eye on the Impulse seesaws, which are large seesaws that light up and make sound while people play on them. It's a really cool interactive art exhibit, especially when it gets dark and you can watch the lights change.
There was a DJ playing and between the music he was playing and the lights from the seesaws, the aquarium, and pier, it was a magical evening. I had lots of fun walking around talking to people and dancing to the music, so I wasn't surprised to see my step count when we got home that night. I'd walked 21,800 steps! All in all, we had a nice time and are looking forward to going again before the event ends on April 3rd. Rock the Riverfront is free and open from 10am - 10pm every day, with the weekends having additional events. For more information visit https://www.rivercitycompany.com/rock
