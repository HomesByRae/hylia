I'm so excited about the next Upcoming Event: Riverbend! Riverbend is a three-day music festival in Chattanooga. It started in 1982 and is in the top 10% of music festivals in the States. It's located downtown at Ross's Landing along the Tennessee River.

 There are three stages and over 20 artists performing. For the artist lineup [click here](https://www.riverbendfestival.com/lineup). There are several artists I can't wait to hear and I'm looking forward to discovering new artists as well.
