I'm so excited about the next Upcoming Event: Riverbend! Riverbend is a three-day music festival in Chattanooga. It started in 1982 and is in the top 10% of music festivals in the States. It's located downtown at Ross's Landing along the Tennessee River.

 There are three stages and over 20 artists performing. For the artist lineup [click here](https://www.riverbendfestival.com/lineup). There are several artists I can't wait to hear and I'm looking forward to discovering new artists as well.

It'll be our first time attending and I'm studying the map of the grounds, making a list of things to take, and deciding on what clothes to wear (comfy shoes are a must!). 

Some tips if you're planning on attending: wear comfy clothes and shoes, bring sunscreen, an empty refillable water bottle (there will be refill stations), and a blanket or towel to lounge on the grass (I like to use a plastic flannel-backed tablecloth). Bags/purses have to be smaller than 12x12x6, and chairs, coolers, pets, and selfie sticks are prohibited.

I hope this helps, and that you're excited like I am. Reach out if you have any questions. I hope to see you there!
