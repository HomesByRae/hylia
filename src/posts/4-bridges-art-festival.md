This past weekend was the [4 Bridges Art Festival,](https://www.avarts.org/about-4baf1) an annual event here in Chattanooga. It is put on by the [Association For Visual Arts](https://www.avarts.org/), and is ranked in the top 20 fine art festivals in the nation. It is a two day festival, with a special ticketed preview party the night before, held at the First Horizon Pavilion.

Some of the categories were: 

* **ceramics**
* **illustration**
* **jewelry**
* **mixed media**
* **paintings**
* **photography**

It was our first time attending and volunteering, and it certainly won't be our last. I had such a good time! I was in awe of all the talented people there. Even though the weather was chilly and a bit gloomy, they had a good turnout. 

If you plan on attending next year here are some tips for you, so you don't make the mistake I did and not spend long enough there:

**Go early and plan to spend the day!**

 We arrived a few minutes before our afternoon shift, and even though we got to walk around and talk to the artists, I wish I had gotten there earlier and just spent time walking around with my husband. There were so many things I saw that I wanted to share with him, but wasn't able to. 

**Plan to get lunch from one of the food trucks on site!**

 There were a couple of food trucks there and the road in front of the pavilion was shut down and turned into an eating area. It was also near the stage, where musicians were serenading everyone. 

**Do a lap (or two) around the event first!**

 If you're someone like me, who finds something to love at each vendor booth, walking around to see what you can see is always a good idea. One caveat though, if you find something you adore, it might be best to buy it when you see it. You could run the risk of not being able to buy the piece you love because someone else beat you to it.

**Grab a business card, or sign up for a newsletter!**

 If you find an artist whose style you love, make sure to follow them on social media. Share their information with your friends, and signing up for their newsletter helps you stay abreast of their latest works and events. 

**Most of all, have fun!**

 Make a day of it, go with people you love to be around, and let the power of art speak to your soul. All the artists I spoke with were happy to interact with me and answer any questions I had about their work, so don't be afraid to chat with them. 

Well, that's all I have for you today. I hope my tips help you the next time you attend an art festival. If you have any tips I didn't cover here, feel free to contact me. I'd love to hear from you!
