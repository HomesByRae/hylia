Today I wanted to share with you some tips from my limited time in Real Estate. Some of these were things I wished I knew when I first started, and others are from either trial and error, or listening to other agents.

Let's begin with a little bit about my Real Estate Journey. I had been thinking of getting into Real Estate off and on for years, so when we moved to Tennessee from Texas it felt like the perfect time. We moved to the Chattanooga area in September of 2019 and were just getting familiar with the city when Covid shut everything down.

In August of 2020, I decided to take the plunge and signed up for an online Real Estate course through [The CE Shop](https://www.theceshop.com/). I knew it was a lot of information to absorb, and I wanted to take my time with the material to make sure I understood everything. I completed the 90 hour course in six months.

Here's my first tip for you: **consider spaced repetition** to help you study the material. It's basically the use of Flash Cards, but the frequency of when you see them varies depending on how well you know the material on them. I recommend reading this article for more information \[]. I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for my flashcards and find it extremely helpful.

So, in March of 2021, I took my licensing exam. My second tip is this: If you have a choice between an online exam or a physical exam, **take the physical exam**. Several agents have had some sort of technical issues with taking it online and for me it wasn't worth the hassle. I also had to get my fingerprints taken for a required background check.

Then I began the task of finding a broker. While you are an Indepent Contractor (which means you're self-employed) you need to have a Broker oversee you for liability reasons. 

My third tip is thus: **interview three Brokers** before making a decision. I interviewed my first Broker in April and then, because of one thing or another, didn't interview by second and third Brokers until September. I cut it close with my deadline, but at worst I would have had to retake my test. 

Once I interviewed my three Brokers, I spent an agonizing weekend trying to figure out which one I liked the best. I was able to elimate one pretty quickly, but the other two I struggled with. I tried a pros and cons list, and it helped some, but I eventually had to rank my two choices based on what I was looking for and how well I thought they each did. In the end it was a difference of 5 points, but I'm happy with where I am now.
