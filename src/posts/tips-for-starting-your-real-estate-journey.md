Today's post is for those of you who are thinking of becoming a Real Estate Agent. I'm going to walk you through the steps I took when I started out.

I signed up for an online Real Estate course through [The CE Shop](https://www.theceshop.com/). I was prepared to take my time because I knew it was a lot of information to absorb, and I wanted to make sure I understood everything.

Here's my first tip for you: **consider spaced repetition.**

Spaced repetition is basically the use of flash cards, but the frequency of when you see them varies depending on how well you know the material. I recommend reading [this article](https://ncase.me/remember/) for more information. I used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for my flashcards and liked it so much I continue to use them.

My second tip is: **take the physical exam**.

Because I took a physical exam I didn't have to worry if my computer had the right software, or if there was something in the room I was in, or my internet connection. I showed up, they checked me in, took my picture, handed me a piece of scratch paper with my name on it and a calculator, and told me what station to sit at.

The exam was in two portions, National and State, but you don't find out your score until the very end. If you don't pass your first time, don't get discouraged. Lots of agents end up taking the test multiple times. If you're anxious about it, do what I did and try to think of it like a practice test. 

I also had to get my fingerprints taken for a required background check. I waited to schedule this until after I had successfully passed my exam, and found out it was right across the street from the testing center. Part of me wishes I had known that and scheduled them on the same day, but it wasn't a big deal to go back.

My third tip is thus: **interview three Brokers** before making a decision. 

You have six months from the date of your passed exam to sign with a Broker. You don't have to wait until you pass your test to interview Brokers, you can do it while you're completing your course.

I was nervous about interviewing Brokers, but I reminded myself that I was interviewing them, not the other way around. The CE Shop provided me with a list of questions to ask potential Brokers, but I also came up with some questions of my own. 

Once I interviewed my three Brokers, I spent an agonizing weekend trying to figure out which one I liked the best. Did I agonize over the decision unnecessarily? Probably. It's common for Agents to change Brokerages as their career evolves, or they discover they don't mesh well with their current broker, but I wanted to make sure I was with the right company for me.

My fourth and final tip: **Be prepared to spend a decent amount of money.**

After signing with a Broker, there are lots of fees and things you'll need to spend money on. Between my course, test, fingerprinting, license application fee, Errors & Omissions Insurance, MLS fees, Association fees, head-shots, website, business cards, and monthly fees I spent about $2,000. 

As a Real Estate Agent, you're considered an Independent Contractor. There are perks to that, such as flexible schedules, but it's hard when you've got money going out every month and nothing coming in. 

Even if you get an accepted offer your very first day as a licensed agent, it'll still take at least 30 days before you receive a commission check. Because of this most of the newer agents in my office have another job, and do Real Estate on the side.

You have to decide what is best for you. Does it make more sense for you to be an Agent on the side? Or are you able to go at it full time? Whatever you decide, I hope you were able to find this information useful!

Contact me if you have any questions, or tips of your own. I'd love to hear from you!
